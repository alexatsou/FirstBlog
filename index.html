            <p> Technology is neither good or bad. In this day in age, we can express ourselves online, and social media has the power to expose us to a wide audience. Bits have made it possible to store that information about so many people and places. Social media can also be good because you can express yourself but it isn’t as nearly as authentic as the real world. Photoshop and other editors can portray a different truth making it hard to trust someone and who they really are behind the scenes. Bits also have the capability to store information about the real world. If a highschool student goes to a  drug abuse counseling because they got searched, the schools has that that information on file and its attached to their identity for the rest of their lives. This affects their chances with jobs and other vital opportunities.  It’s up to the people to be responsible because everything online is permanent making it harder but new for everyone to be flexible and fluid in society.
