            <p> Technology is neither good or bad. In this day in age, we can express ourselves online, and social media has the power to expose us to a wide audience. Bits have made it possible to store that information about so many people and places. Social media can also be good because you can express yourself but it isn’t as nearly as authentic as the real world. Photoshop and other editors can portray a different truth making it hard to trust someone and who they really are behind the scenes. Bits also have the capability to store information about the real world. If a highschool student goes to a  drug abuse counseling because they got searched, the schools has that that information on file and its attached to their identity for the rest of their lives. This affects their chances with jobs and other vital opportunities.  It’s up to the people to be responsible because everything online is permanent making it harder but new for everyone to be flexible and fluid in society.

           <p>Cornell's department of computing and information science looked into web security and how you browse the interenet affects the information you provide to companies. Professor Arvind Narayanan proves that people's internet activity can convery information to companies through analizing certain methods. A method a lot of companies use is called "canvas finger printing" which draws an invisible image on a loaded page and is read back as a series of bits this is essentially a combination of pixels sent to various companies. Another method is deteching battery percentage. It's unlikely that two people will have the same battery % viewing the same web page at the same time making it easy for companies to track web acitvity on an device. Often times when given the option to erase your history you have to erase your cookies as well because these cookies are just bits on a computer can be used to tie that history back to any specific person at any specfic time. So what? Narayanana argues that companies are taking advanage of us and our digitial lives. There is no freedom of speech because all that information can be tracked back to you. Nothing is anonomyous online.
